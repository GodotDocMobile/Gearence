	Occludes light cast by a Light2D, thus casting shadows.</brief_description><description>
	Occludes light cast by a Light2D, thus casting shadows. The LightOccluder2D must be provided with a shape (see OccluderPolygon2D) that allows the shadow to be computed. This shape affects the resulting shadow, while the shape of the representating asset shadowed does not actually affect shadows.</description><methods><method name="get_occluder_light_mask" qualifiers="const"><return type="int"></return><description>
